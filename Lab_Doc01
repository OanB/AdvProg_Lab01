Introduction:

What I did here is to apply the method of Strassen’s Algorithm in C++ language to and then comparing it with iterative method to gain the time complexity and the idea that with algorithm works faster.

Approach:

•	We used two 2x2 matrices here
•	We allocated random values in those matrices
•	Then we displayed those matrices
•	Then we started the time counter
•	We applied the method of Strassen’s algorithm here
•	We gained the Resultant matrix.
•	We stopped the time
•	We Displayed the matrix and showed the time
•	We restarted the time
•	We Applied the method of iterative multiplication
•	We stopped the time
•	We displayed the time of the iterative method.

Analysis:

We gained the result in such a way which showed that the time of iterative method is more than Strassen’s Algorithm.
